dnsresolve (in-progress)
===

This program is a DNS lookup utility like nsresolve or dig. This is an 
extension of an honors project from a networking course that I took in 
college.  The project was originally written in Java and is now being 
converted to C. Currently, this project only runs on Linux.

## Requirements
  1. Linux OS
  2. GNU Make

## How to Compile
Compiling the project is very simple. Simply run

    make
    
and the executable should be built. Then to run, just type

    bin/runner

## Developers
